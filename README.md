### ✨ Hi, I'm Adrian ✨

As an Associate Distinguished Engineer and Sr Software Development Engineer, I architect full-stack solutions that turn complex medical data into intuitive, impactful systems. My work in diagnostic imaging and data visualization is driven by a clear goal: accelerating patient diagnosis and treatment.

This passion for building extends beyond my professional role. I am an insatiably curious engineer and innovator at heart, which has led me to build and maintain a personal portfolio of over 20 side projects. This continuous, hands-on exploration of new architectures and technologies isn't just a hobby—it's my engine for discovery, keeping me sharp and allowing me to bring a creative, battle-tested perspective to my team.

I thrive on deep collaboration with domain experts—scientists, pathologists, and clinicians—to truly understand the core problem. My philosophy is that technology is a tool for a purpose; it's not about just fixing bugs or implementing features, but about architecting elegant, scalable, and end-to-end solutions that solve the right challenges.

I am always looking to connect with fellow innovators and leaders. Please reach out if you'd like to discuss full-stack architecture, the future of healthcare technology, or creative-problem solving.
