### âœ¨ Hi, I'm Adrian âœ¨

##### LinkedIn Blurb

An award-winning Software Engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a passion for data visualization, I thrive on turning complex concepts into intuitive, impactful solutions.

After garnering 21 awards from various hackathons and tech competitions during college, where I developed innovative solutions from IoT microservice networks to AR viewers for chemistry education, I now serve as a Software Engineer at a globally-ranked biomedical and pharma company. In this role, I collaborate across four projects and three teams, developing a 3D viewer for pathology and radiology that accelerates the time to diagnose and treat patients.

A dedicated lifelong learner, I've honed my skills across TypeScript, Python, C/C++, Golang, and Java, and I'm comfortable with an array of tools and frameworks such as React, Angular, GoFiber, Flask, Django, Express, WebGPU, WebGL, Mongo, Postgres, MySQL, AWS, GCP, and Docker, to name a few. I also hold multiple LinkedIn certifications, with AWS and Google AI/ML certifications currently in progress.

I strongly believe in the transformative power of technology, and I'm committed to using it to enhance people's lives. My work isn't just about bug fixingâ€”it's about collaborating with experts, identifying problems, and crafting creative, effective solutions. My aspiration is to continue developing applications that make an impact and bring about positive change in our world.
